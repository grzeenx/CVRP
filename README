#CVRP

Different approaches were tested to solve CVRP (Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem):
ACO (different variants), PSO, greedy and random (for comparison purposes). All of the results were put in the report (raport_pl.txt which is in Polish)
To run the experiments and get the results you should run the main.py script.

Project was created to complete the assignment at the Methods of Artificial Intelligence course.
